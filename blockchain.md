# Decentralized Agreement (smart contracts)

* Smart contracts are the set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.

# Difference between bitcoin and ethereum
* bitcoin is the first protocol to take this blockchain technology into limelight and take these cryptocurrencies into the main stream bitcoin is the sort of digital gold or a store of values.
* bitcoin is intentionally "turing incomplete"
* bitcoin built as store of values

* Ethereum take this blockchain technology one step further, enabling people to make smart contracts and decentralized trust minimized agreements.
* ethereum built as store of values and utility to facilitate these decentralized agreement.

* The smart contracts and decentralized applications can access and interact with the real world using something called decentralized oracle networks.


# Blockchains are intentionally walled off
Blockchain itself can't interact with and can't read or listen data from the real world, that is known as oracle problem.
everything happens, it's happens in there world.

# Blockchain Oracle
Any device that interact with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contract.

# Hybrid smart contracts
on-chain + off-chain agreement

# Dapp = decentralized application = decentralized protocols = smart contracts

# what is the value of smart contract?
Trust minimize agreement, unbreakable promises (pinky promise)

An agreement, contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a blockchain and once it's deployed
1. it can't be altered
2. automatically executes
3. everyone sees the terms of the agreement

# what have smart contract done so far?
DeFi = Decentralized Finance
DAOs
NFTs

# Create an account on metamask
- copy the account address and search on blockchain explorer ( etherscan )

1. Transaction hash

# Gas
- A unit of computational measurement.
- The more complex your transaction is the more gas you have to pay.
- Any transaction on the blockchain comes with paying gas.
- The more people send transactions at the same time the more expensive your gas costs are
- Transaction fee = Gas Price * How much gas you used
